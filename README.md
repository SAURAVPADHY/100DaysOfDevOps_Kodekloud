# 100 Days of DevOps â€“ KodeKloud

Welcome to the **100 Days of DevOps** challenge, inspired by KodeKloud! This repository documents my journey as I learn and practice DevOps concepts, tools, and best practices over 100 days.

## About
This challenge is designed to help you build a strong foundation in DevOps by working on daily tasks, projects, and hands-on labs. Each day focuses on a specific topic or tool, with notes, code, and resources shared in this repository.

## Structure
- Daily progress and notes will be added as markdown files or folders for each day.
- Resources, scripts, and configuration files will be organized by topic.

## Topics Covered
Some of the topics you can expect to find here:
- Linux & Shell Scripting
- Version Control with Git & GitHub
