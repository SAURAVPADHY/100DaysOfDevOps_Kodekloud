As part of the temporary assignment to the Nautilus project, a developer named john requires access for a limited duration. To ensure smooth access management, a temporary user account with an expiry date is needed. Here's what you need to do:

**Task:**

- Create a user named `john` on **App Server 2** in Stratos Datacenter.
- Set the expiry date to `2024-02-17`, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.

> **Note:** You can find the infrastructure details by clicking on the **Details of all Users and Servers** button on the top-right section of the page.
